>The raw footages of the movies are considerably in huge amount and they are unorganized, e.g. different scenes in a same clip, retakes. It would be troublesome to prepare the video clips in right sequence and organized before actual editing. To save human resources and have a better overview of the video raw footage, there are needs for dealing with massive unedited rushes (raw footage) automatically to summarize the digital videos -- rushes editing.
